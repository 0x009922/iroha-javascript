# docs recipes

A collection of code snippets with common Iroha 2 recipes for the documentation.

### Why as a separated package

-   Collect all recipes in a single place
-   Possible to use actual imports (like `@iroha2/client`)
-   The written code is affected by global repo type-check, so it's kind of doc tests
