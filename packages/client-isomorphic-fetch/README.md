# `@iroha2/client-isomorphic-fetch`

**This package is no longer in use.** Check [`client`](../client/README.md) for the instructions on how to use isomorphic Fetch API.

> `@iroha2/client-isomorphic-fetch` was previously used to switch between environment-specific transports. It used  `node-fetch` package in CJS mode (in Node.js) and native Fetch API in ESM mode (in a browser).
